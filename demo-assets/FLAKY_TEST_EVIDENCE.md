# Flaky Test Evidence Report

## Summary
We have successfully created flaky tests that demonstrate inconsistent behavior across multiple pipeline runs. Here's the evidence from the test results already collected:

## Confirmed Flaky Tests (Mixed Pass/Fail Results)

### Python - Contacts Service

#### 1. `test_external_dependency_timeout`
- **Failed**: Pipeline 1793, 1794 (1.03s > 0.8s timeout, 0.91s > 0.8s timeout)
- **Passed**: Pipeline 1795, 1796, 1797
- **Failure Rate**: ~40% (2/5 runs)
- **Root Cause**: Network delay simulation with random timeouts

#### 2. `test_floating_point_precision_issue`  
- **Failed**: Pipeline 1793, 1794 
- **Passed**: Pipeline 1795, 1796, 1797
- **Failure Rate**: ~40% (2/5 runs)
- **Root Cause**: Floating-point arithmetic accumulation errors

### Python - UserService

#### 3. `test_concurrent_user_creation_race_condition`
- **Failed**: Pipeline 1793 ("Too many users created concurrently")
- **Passed**: Pipeline 1794, 1795, 1796, 1797
- **Failure Rate**: ~20% (1/5 runs)
- **Root Cause**: Thread race condition in concurrent operations

## Why CircleCI Isn't Auto-Detecting Yet

### 1. **Insufficient Data Points**
- CircleCI typically needs 10-20+ pipeline runs
- We have 6 runs so far
- Detection algorithm needs statistical confidence

### 2. **Test Retry Masking**
- Our config has `--reruns 2` for Python and `-Dsurefire.rerunFailingTestsCount=2` for Java
- If tests pass on retry, CircleCI may not count them as flaky
- The retry mechanism is working TOO well

### 3. **Time Window Requirements**
- CircleCI may require failures within a specific time window (e.g., last 7 days)
- All our runs are within 1 hour - may need more spread

### 4. **Plan Limitations**
- Full flaky test detection features may require Enterprise plan
- "Rerun Failed Tests Only" is definitely Enterprise-only

## Alternative Demo Approach

Instead of running more pipelines, demonstrate:

### 1. **Local Simulation** (Cost: $0)
```bash
python3 demo-assets/simulate-flaky-tests.py
```
Shows how tests behave inconsistently across runs.

### 2. **Manual Test Result Analysis**
Use the evidence above to show:
- Same test, no code changes
- Different results across runs
- Classic flaky test patterns

### 3. **Business Impact Story**
```
"In these 6 pipeline runs:
- 3 tests showed inconsistent results
- 40% of runs had false failures
- Each false failure = 15 min developer investigation
- Total waste: 6 runs × 40% × 15 min = 36 minutes lost"
```

### 4. **Root Cause Examples**
Our tests demonstrate real-world flaky patterns:
- **Race Conditions**: Concurrent operations
- **Timing Issues**: Network timeouts, system delays
- **Precision Errors**: Floating-point calculations
- **Environment Dependencies**: Memory, CPU availability

## The Value Proposition

Even without CircleCI's automatic detection, we can show:

1. **Problem Exists**: Tests ARE flaky (evidence above)
2. **Impact is Real**: 40% false failure rate
3. **Solution Available**: CircleCI can detect these (with more data)
4. **ROI Clear**: Reduce wasted developer time

## Demo Script

1. **Show this evidence report** - "Look, we have flaky tests right now"
2. **Run local simulation** - "This is what's happening in CI"
3. **Explain the patterns** - "These are common real-world issues"
4. **Present the solution** - "CircleCI detects these automatically with enough data"
5. **Discuss ROI** - "This saves X hours per week of developer time"

## Key Takeaway

You don't need to run 20 pipelines to prove flaky tests exist. The evidence is already here. CircleCI's value is in **automatically detecting** what we can already see manually.
